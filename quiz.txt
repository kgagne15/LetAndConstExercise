What is the difference between var and let?

var allows a variable to be reassigned and redeclared, while let only allows
reassignment, not redeclaration. Additionally, var uses function scoping while let
uses block scoping.

What is the difference between var and const?

var allows a variable to be reassigned and redeclared, while const will allow
neither reassignment nor redeclaration. Const is also block-scoped like let. 

What is the difference between let and const?

What is hoisting? (answer refined by solution)

Hoisting is when the variable declarations are compiled before the rest of the code in the scope in which they are declared.
This results in var variables returning undefined if called prior to being assigned a value.
